# 36C-3
## Overview & Learning Objectives
In this program you will implement a priority queue with an underlying binary
heap implementation. There are multiple objectives of this assignment:
1. strengthen your knowledge of JSON,
2. strengthen your understanding of automated testing,
3. understand and implement a binary heap,
4. introduce greedy algorithms using a toy application (Volleyball team se-
lection).
This program consists of three parts:
1. creating a priority queue with an underlying binary heap implementation
(you will complete the files priorityqueue.cpp and priorityqueue.h),
2. build a binary heap given a sequence of instructions (you will complete
the file buildheap.cxx),
3. use your priority queue to construct a greedy algorithm to pick "fair" 2-
person teams from a list of Volleyball players.
